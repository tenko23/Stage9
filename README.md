# Stage9

This is the public issue tracker for Stage9, the Unreal 4 based replica of the Enterprise 1701-D.

Thanks for being a test version bug reporter!

You’re probably already used to typing your bugs in the Discord bug-reports channel, but as we grow larger the Discord bug-reports channel is becoming less and less useful. Easier to type, but WAY harder for us to determine what bug is being experienced by what computer, what OS, what issue is causing it, etc. Even worse, so many will report the same bug with no information behind it! So we are now using Github exclusively for bug reporting.

https://github.com/dapperrobotbear/Stage9

1. Go ^ there, and Sign Up. Make whatever account/password you want. On the second page it says Choose Your Plan. Keep the free one, it doesn’t matter. Unlimited Public Repositories. Don’t bother with the other checkboxes. Page 3 is about you. You can choose Skip this Step at the bottom. After that, please go to your email to verify your account. You can then click this above link again to take you back to the Stage 9 github.
At the top, you’ll see some tabs, and you’ll already be on "code". See the tab “issues”? Click that. You’ll see a list of issues in there.

2. CHECK THESE “issues” to make sure your bug is not already there!!!

No, really. CHECK THESE to make sure your bug is not already there!!! Memorize them if you have to! GO INTO EACH ONE as some may have multiple bugs! They will be rearranged and notated a LOT so pay close attention!

If it is, or it’s close enough, click on it. There’s a space box below the issue where you can also write your own info. We need to know if multiple users are experiencing the same bug. Please write your own experience and basic info about your computer (OS, processor, video card, etc) and what program you are running – VR, mac, windows 64 bit, etc…

3. IF IT ISN’T AND YOU’VE CHECKED THEM ALL TWICE TO MAKE SURE– Click on that nice green button called “New Issue”. 

On the next page is a place to write. Put in a subject that decently covers the issue, and then the details with as much info as you can in the writing section. You can also attach files. Then click Submit and your issue is now in the system as a thread. It will be prioritized as needed and if a dev needs more info they will send a message. You can respond in your same “thread” as needed. That’s all you need to do! 

4. If you have more than one bug in one room, please keep it in one thread and mention multiple bugs in the title. (Example: Multiple Bugs - Glitch in Deck 5 hallway, 3 places blah blah) No need to have a thread per each bug. Also if you’ve experienced the same bug as someone else, leave a comment in their thread that you have as well! Having ~3 people verify seeing the bug on their computers is pretty helpful! 

5. One of the main developers will look at the bugs and try to replicate it. If they fix it they will mark it as “fixed -needs verified”. The next QA version will hopefully no longer have the bug. Please verify that the bug is fixed, and close your ticket (if all bugs in your ticket have been fixed and you’ve verified them all). Other people who verify your bug is fixed may also close your ticket for you if you’re not available to do so, especially if we need to move quickly. Messaging Strato (who is always online though he never looks like he is) to close your ticket can also be done. Repeat steps 2-5 for the next QA version.

We want you to primarily use the Github for reporting the bugs, the Feedback channels are mainly for, well, feedback to help us improve quality-wise in each Operating System or type of project. Feedback Lobby is for random chat.

Extra Notes and Questions

Q: Should multiple people verify my bug before it gets fixed? 
A: Yes, but we’re looking at all of the submitted bugs equally. But the more people verify they see it across multiple platforms, the better! It helps the devs duplicate the bug faster! 

Have fun playing and finding all those little nasty critters hiding in V 0.0.10!
