# Stage9

This is the public issue tracker for Stage9, the Unreal 4 based replica of the Enterprise 1701-D.

Thanks for coming to report a bug!

You’re probably already used to typing your bugs in the Discord bug-reports channel, but as we grow larger the Discord bug-reports channel is becoming less and less useful. Easier to type, but WAY harder for us to determine what bug is being experienced by what computer, what OS, what issue is causing it, etc. Even worse, so many will report the same bug with no information behind it! So we are now using Github exclusively for bug reporting.

1. Sign Up. Make whatever account/password you want. On the second page it says Choose Your Plan. Keep the free one, it doesn’t matter. Unlimited Public Repositories. Don’t bother with the other checkboxes. Page 3 is about you. You can choose Skip this Step at the bottom. After that, please go to your email to verify your account. You can then return here.
At the top, you’ll see some tabs, and you’ll already be on "code". See the tab “issues”? Click that. You’ll see a list of issues in there.

2. CHECK THESE “issues” to make sure your bug is not already there!!!

No, really. CHECK THESE to make sure your bug is not already there!!! 

If it is, or it’s close enough, click on it. There’s a space box below the issue where you can also write your own info. We need to know if multiple users are experiencing the same bug. Please write your own information to add to it. 

3. IF IT ISN’T AND YOU’VE CHECKED THEM ALL TWICE TO MAKE SURE– Click on that nice green button called “New Issue”. 

On the next page is a place to write the details with as much info as you can in the writing section within the template provided. You can also attach files. Then click Submit and your issue is now in the system as a thread. It will be prioritized as needed and if a Dev/Tester needs more info they will send a message. You can respond in your same “thread” as needed. That’s all you need to do! 

4. If you have more than one bug in one room, please keep it in one thread and mention multiple bugs in the title. (Example: Multiple Bugs - Glitch in Deck 5 hallway, 3 places blah blah) No need to have a thread per each bug. Also if you’ve experienced the same bug as someone else, leave a comment in their thread that you have as well! Having ~3 people verify seeing the bug on their computers is pretty helpful! 

5. One of the developers will look at the bugs and try to replicate it. If they fix it they will mark it as “fixed -needs verified”. The next version will hopefully no longer have the bug. The Dev/Testing Team verify your bug is fixed and will close your ticket for you. Messaging Strato(@TheStrato on Git) (who is always online though he never looks like he is) can help you with any problems you might have with this process. Repeat steps 2-5 for the next bug.

We want you to use the Github for reporting the bugs, the Feedback channels are mainly for, well, feedback to help us improve quality-wise in each Operating System or type of project. Feedback Lobby is for random chat.

Have fun playing and finding all those little nasty critters hiding in V 0.0.10!
